# Surfs Up Challenge

### Project Overview
An entrepreneur is looking to start a surf and ice-cream stop and shop on the one of Hawaii’s islands, Oahu, and possible other island locations close by. Making use of data analytics, the entrepreneur would need to prove to a group of investors that the temperatures on the islands are ideal for his venture. With access to Hawaii’s weather records via hawaii.slite, we are able to investigate the precipitation readings from January 1,2010 to August 23, 2017, the owner already knows the average annual weather conditions on the island are favorable. However, the entrepreneur would like to investigate if his venture, the surf and ice-cream stop and shop, is feasible year-round. In particular, the owner would like to investigate the weather conditions on the island of Oahu in June and December.

### Results
The following results were generated after the completion of the analysis of the database:
June's Temperature Statistics:
<ul>
  <li>The average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees (F) </li>
  <li>The temperature ranges from 64 to 85 degrees on the island of Oahu </li>
  <li>The standard distributions of the temperatures are shown below</li>
</ul>
