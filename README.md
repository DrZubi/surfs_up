# Surfs Up Challenge

### Project Overview
An entrepreneur is looking to start a surf and ice-cream stop and shop on the one of Hawaii’s islands, Oahu, and possible other island locations close by. Making use of data analytics, the entrepreneur would need to prove to a group of investors that the temperatures on the islands are ideal for his venture. With access to Hawaii’s weather records via hawaii.slite, we are able to investigate the precipitation readings from January 1,2010 to August 23, 2017, the owner already knows the average annual weather conditions on the island are favorable. However, the entrepreneur would like to investigate if his venture, the surf and ice-cream stop and shop, is feasible year-round. In particular, the owner would like to investigate the weather conditions on the island of Oahu in June and December.

### Results
The following results were generated after the completion of the analysis of the database:
June's Temperature Statistics:
<ul>
  <li>The average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees (F) </li>
  <li>The temperature ranges from 64 to 85 degrees on the island of Oahu </li>
  <li>The standard distributions of the temperatures are shown below</li>
</ul>

December's Temperature Statistics:
<ul>
  <li>The average temperature in December is 71.04 degrees (F) </li>
  <li>The temperature ranges from 56 to 83 degrees on the island of Oahu </li>
  <li>The standard distributions of the temperatures are shown below</li>
</ul>  

![Dec](https://github.com/DrZubi/surfs_up/blob/main/images/Dec%20Summary%20Stats.PNG)

Key differences between the weather in the months of June and December:
<ul>
  <li>The average temperature in December is lower than June  </li>
  <li>The distribution of the range of temperatures for December are larger than that of the temperatures in June </li>
  <li>The temperatures in December the maximum temperature in June is higher than that of December</li>
</ul>  


### Summary
After the completion of the analysis, the historical data of the weather in June and December show very few differences. Mostly, the temperatures for both months fall into the same range. December, historically, has reached lower temperatures than June. For the most part, these temperatures are still ideal for the surf and ice-cream stop and shop!

Additional queries could be done to expand the analysis of the database. Queries, such as finding the difference precipitation between June and December can be investigated. Other queries can also be used to look at the descriptive temperature statistics for other months to predict future high and low customer seasons. Additional queries can also investigate if weather temperatures are cooling/heating on average throughout the years.
